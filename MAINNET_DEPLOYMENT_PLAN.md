## CONTRACT CODE REVIEW

### 1. REMOVE TEST/DEBUG FUNCTIONS

#### ‚ùå MUST REMOVE: `resetVrfTiming()`
**Location**: `contracts/src/PepedawnRaffle.sol:409-411`

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Reset VRF timing for testing purposes
 * @dev Only available for testing - should be removed in production
 */
function resetVrfTiming() external onlyOwner {
    lastVrfRequestTime = 0;
}
```

**Action**: Delete this function entirely before mainnet deployment.  
**Reason**: Test function that bypasses security timing checks.  
**Impact**: Security vulnerability if left in production.

---

### 2. REVIEW CIRCUIT BREAKER LIMITS

**Current Settings**:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_PARTICIPANTS_PER_ROUND = 10000; // Line 41
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_WAGER_PER_ROUND = 1000 ether; // Line 42
```

**Questions to Answer**:
- [ ] Is 1000 ETH per round reasonable for mainnet? (Worth $3-4M at current prices)
- [ ] Should we start with lower limits (e.g., 100 ETH) for first few rounds?
- [ ] Do we need dynamic adjustment based on ETH price?

**Recommendation**: 
- Start with **100 ETH limit** for Round 1-3
- Increase to **500 ETH** for Rounds 4-10  
- Use full **1000 ETH** after proven stable

---

### 3. GAS OPTIMIZATION REVIEW

#### VRF Gas Estimation Constants
```solidity
uint32 public constant VRF_MIN_CALLBACK_GAS = 400000; // Line 46
uint32 public constant VRF_MAX_CALLBACK_GAS = 2500000; // Line 49
```

**Mainnet Considerations**:
- Base fee on mainnet is typically **10-50 gwei** (vs 1-5 gwei Sepolia)
- Priority fees add **1-5 gwei** during normal times
- During congestion: **100-500 gwei** possible

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Test callback gas usage with 100+ participants
- [ ] Test with 1000+ participants (max scenario)
- [ ] Verify gas estimation logic works at mainnet gas prices
- [ ] Consider adding max gas price safety check

---

### 4. EMBLEM VAULT INTEGRATION

**Current Implementation** (Lines 131-132, 341-342, 642, 697):
```solidity
address public emblemVaultAddress;
IERC721 public emblemVault; // Standard ERC721 interface
```

**Our contract uses**: Standard ERC721 interface (simple, clean ‚úì)  
**Emblem Vault SDK provides**: Advanced vault creation/management tools (not needed for basic custody)

---

#### üéØ MAINNET MIGRATION PLAN

**Contract Addresses**:
Based on Emblem SDK docs, Emblem Vault uses different addresses per network:
- **Sepolia**: Test/mock address (current)
- **Mainnet**: Must identify the specific Emblem Vault collection contract

**üìã ACTION ITEMS** (in order):

#### Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1)
- [ ] **Identify which Emblem Vault collection** you're using for prizes
  - Are these curated vaults? Custom collection? Existing NFTs?
  - Get the mainnet contract address for that specific collection
- [ ] **Verify contract is ERC721 compliant** on mainnet:
  ```bash
  cast call $EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET "supportsInterface(bytes4)" "0x80ac58cd" --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
  # Should return: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 (true)
  ```
- [ ] **Confirm NFT inventory**:
  - How many NFTs available? (contract assumes 133 total)
  - Which token IDs? (contract maps: 1-10 Fake, 11-50 Kek, 51-133 Pepe)
  - Who currently owns them?

#### Phase 2: Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] **Fork test NFT operations**:
  ```bash
  # Fork mainnet
  anvil --fork-url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
  
  # Test ownership check
  cast call $EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET "ownerOf(uint256)" $TOKEN_ID --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
  
  # Test transfer to contract (simulate)
  cast send $EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET "safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)" \
    $CURRENT_OWNER $CONTRACT_ADDRESS $TOKEN_ID --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
  ```
- [ ] **Test contract's prize claiming flow** on fork with real Emblem Vault contract
- [ ] **Verify gas costs** for `safeTransferFrom` with Emblem Vault NFTs

#### Phase 3: Pre-Deployment Prep (Week 3)
- [ ] **Gather prize NFTs**:
  - Minimum 10 NFTs for Round 1 (contract validates this in `setPrizesForRound`)
  - Ensure you control the wallet that owns them
  - Document token IDs: `[id1, id2, id3, ..., id10]`
- [ ] **Calculate gas budget** for NFT transfers:
  - 10 NFTs √ó ~65,000 gas √ó current gas price = transfer cost
  - At 30 gwei: ~0.02 ETH total

#### Phase 4: Deployment Day
- [ ] **Deploy contract** with mainnet Emblem Vault address:
  ```bash
  # In Deploy.s.sol constructor:
  EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET = 0x...; # The actual mainnet address
  ```
- [ ] **Transfer NFTs to contract** (before opening round):
  ```bash
  # For each prize NFT (use owner wallet):
  cast send $EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET \
    "safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)" \
    $YOUR_ADDRESS \
    $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    $TOKEN_ID \
    --private-key $OWNER_KEY \
    --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
  ```
- [ ] **Verify contract ownership**:
  ```bash
  # Check contract owns all 10 NFTs
  for id in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do
    cast call $EMBLEM_VAULT_MAINNET "ownerOf(uint256)" $id --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
  done
  ```
- [ ] **Set prizes for Round 1**:
  ```bash
  cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    "setPrizesForRound(uint256,uint256[])" \
    1 "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]" \
    --private-key $OWNER_KEY \
    --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
  ```

---

#### üîç KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER NOW

1. **Which Emblem Vault contract are you using?**
   - Emblem Vault V2? V3? A specific curated collection?
   - Contract address on mainnet?

2. **Do you have the NFTs?**
   - 133 NFTs as coded? Or starting with fewer?
   - Are they already minted on mainnet?
   - What wallet currently owns them?

3. **Prize allocation strategy**:
   - Using the hardcoded mapping (1-10, 11-50, 51-133)?
   - Or dynamic selection per round?

4. **NFT replenishment plan**:
   - After distributing 10 NFTs/round, how to get more?
   - Buy on secondary market? Mint new? Partner with Emblem?

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISKS

1. **Wrong Contract Address**: If you deploy with wrong Emblem Vault address, prizes won't transfer
   - **Mitigation**: Test on fork first, verify `ownerOf()` and `safeTransferFrom()` work
   
2. **NFT Not Owned**: If contract doesn't own the NFT, claim will fail
   - **Mitigation**: Pre-transfer all NFTs before opening round, validate in `setPrizesForRound()`
   
3. **Token ID Mismatch**: If hardcoded IDs don't exist, claims fail
   - **Mitigation**: Document exact token IDs, update `_getPrizeAssetId()` if needed


## Emergency Recovery
If NFT stuck: Use `emergencyWithdrawNFT()` (owner only)
```

### 5. CONSTANTS VALIDATION

#### Wager Amounts (Realistic for Mainnet?)
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_WAGER = 0.005 ether; // ~$12-18 at current prices
uint256 public constant BUNDLE_5_PRICE = 0.0225 ether; // ~$60-80
uint256 public constant BUNDLE_10_PRICE = 0.04 ether; // ~$100-150
```

**Consider**:
- Is $12 minimum too high/low for participation?
- Gas costs on mainnet: $5-50+ per transaction during congestion
- Users need to factor in: bet cost + gas + proof submission gas + claim gas

**Recommendation**: Monitor first round closely and be ready to adjust in v2.

#### Round Duration
```solidity
uint256 public constant ROUND_DURATION = 2 weeks;
```

**Considerations**:
- Marketing time: Is 2 weeks enough to build hype?
- Too short: Not enough participation
- Too long: Users lose interest
- Consider 3-4 weeks for first rounds on mainnet

---

### 6. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS

#### Add Version Tracking
```solidity
// Add to contract
string public constant VERSION = "1.0.0-mainnet";
uint256 public immutable DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP;

constructor(...) {
    DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP = block.timestamp;
    // ... rest of constructor
}
```

#### Add Contract Pause Reason
```solidity
string public pauseReason; // Add state variable

function pause(string calldata reason) external onlyOwner {
    pauseReason = reason;
    _pause();
    emit ContractPaused(reason, block.timestamp);
}
```

#### Improve Emergency Withdrawal
```solidity
// Current: 24-hour wait (Line 1388-1392)
require(
    block.timestamp >= lastVrfRequestTime + 24 hours, 
    "Must wait 24 hours after last activity"
);
```

**Consider**: Should mainnet have **7-day timelock** for emergency withdrawals?

## CONFIGURATION CHANGES

### 1. NETWORK CONFIGURATION

#### Current (Sepolia)
```javascript
// frontend/src/contract-config.js
export const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
  address: "0x7Be07bE03603a44c64A81bcEFDe2Bedc38b1f5d0",
  network: 'sepolia',
  chainId: 11155111,
}
```

export const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
  address: "0x__DEPLOY_TO_MAINNET__", // Will be filled on deployment
  network: 'mainnet',
  chainId: 1,
}
```

**Files to Update**:
- [ ] `frontend/src/contract-config.js`
- [ ] `deploy/artifacts/addresses.json`
- [ ] `frontend/public/deploy/artifacts/addresses.json`
- [ ] `contracts/.env` (add MAINNET_RPC_URL)
- [ ] All README/documentation

---

### 2. CHAINLINK VRF CONFIGURATION

#### Current VRF Settings (Sepolia)
```json
{
  "coordinator": "0x8103B0A8A00be2DDC778e6e7eaa21791Cd364625",
  "subscriptionId": 1,
  "keyHash": "0x474e34a077df58807dbe9c96d3c009b23b3c6d0cce433e59bbf5b34f823bc56c"
}
```

#### Mainnet VRF Requirements

**VRF Coordinator Address**: `0x271682DEB8C4E0901D1a1550aD2e64D568E69909` (VRF v2.5)  
**Key Hash (500 gwei)**: `0x8af398995b04c28e9951adb9721ef74c74f93e6a478f39e7e0777be13527e7ef`  
**Key Hash (200 gwei)**: `0xff8dedfbfa60af186cf3c830acbc32c05aae823045ae5ea7da1e45fbfaba4f92`  
**Key Hash (100 gwei)**: `0x9fe0eebf5e446e3c998ec9bb19951541aee00bb90ea201ae456421a2ded86805`

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create new VRF subscription on mainnet via https://vrf.chain.link
- [ ] Fund subscription with **20-50 LINK** minimum
- [ ] Add deployed contract as consumer
- [ ] Choose appropriate key hash based on gas requirements
- [ ] Update `deploy/artifacts/vrf-config.json`
- [ ] Test VRF on mainnet with small transaction first

**Cost Estimation**:
```
VRF Cost = 0.25 LINK + gas * LINK/ETH exchange rate
Gas for 500k callback ~= 0.02-0.1 ETH worth of LINK
Total per round: ~0.35-0.5 LINK
20 LINK = ~40-60 rounds of operation
```

---

### 3. WALLET SETUP

#### Owner Wallet (Critical)

**Current Setup**: Single EOA (Externally Owned Account)  
**Mainnet Requirement**: **MULTI-SIG WALLET**

**Recommended**: Gnosis Safe with 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 configuration

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Deploy Gnosis Safe on mainnet
- [ ] Add 2-5 signers (trusted team members)
- [ ] Set threshold (e.g., 2-of-3 required for transactions)
- [ ] Test Safe operation on Sepolia first
- [ ] Document all signer addresses
- [ ] Store recovery phrases in separate secure locations

**Alternative**: If staying with EOA:
- [ ] Use hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor)
- [ ] Never expose private key
- [ ] Have backup hardware wallet
- [ ] Use separate "hot wallet" for small operations

#### Creators Address
```solidity
address public creatorsAddress; // Receives 80% of wagers
```

**Current**: Likely same as owner  
**Mainnet Consideration**: 
- Should this be a payment splitter contract?
- Multi-sig for fund management?
- Consider tax/legal implications

---

### 4. IPFS CONFIGURATION

**Current Setup** (contracts/scripts/cli/upload-to-ipfs.js):
- Uses Pinata or similar service
- API keys in environment variables

**Mainnet Requirements**:
- [ ] Production Pinata account (or Infura IPFS)
- [ ] Separate API keys for mainnet
- [ ] Backup IPFS provider
- [ ] Monitor pin status
- [ ] Have fallback hosting (S3/CDN) for critical files

**Files that need IPFS**:
- Participants JSON (each round)
- Winners JSON (each round)
- Prize metadata
- Round documentation

---

### 5. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

#### New `.env` Structure

```bash
# Mainnet Configuration
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # USE HARDWARE WALLET OR ENCRYPTED
CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=0x... # Filled after deployment

# Chainlink VRF Mainnet
VRF_COORDINATOR_MAINNET=0x271682DEB8C4E0901D1a1550aD2e64D568E69909
VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_MAINNET=TBD
VRF_KEY_HASH_MAINNET=0x8af398995b04c28e9951adb9721ef74c74f93e6a478f39e7e0777be13527e7ef

# Addresses
CREATORS_ADDRESS=0x... # Multi-sig or payment splitter
EMBLEM_VAULT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=0x... # Real Emblem Vault contract

# IPFS (Production)
PINATA_API_KEY_PROD=...
PINATA_SECRET_KEY_PROD=...

# Security
PAUSE_ENABLED=false # Only enable if needed
EMERGENCY_CONTACT=email@domain.com
```

**Security Notes**:
- Never commit mainnet private keys to git
- Use encrypted environment variable storage
- Consider using secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

## GAS COST ANALYSIS

### Deployment Costs

#### Contract Deployment
```
Contract Size: ~24kb (below 24.576kb limit ‚úì)
Deployment Gas: ~4,000,000 - 5,000,000 gas

At different gas prices:
- 30 gwei: ~0.12-0.15 ETH ($350-500)
- 50 gwei: ~0.20-0.25 ETH ($600-850)
- 100 gwei: ~0.40-0.50 ETH ($1,200-1,700)
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Current: Uses `via_ir = true` (IR-based compilation)
- Consider: Deploy with `optimizer_runs = 999999` for gas-efficient runtime

**Action**: Deploy during low-gas period (weekends, 2-6 AM EST)

#### Initial Setup (Post-Deployment)
```solidity
1. Add VRF consumer: ~46,000 gas
2. Create first round: ~150,000 gas  
3. Set prizes: ~500,000 gas (10 NFTs)
4. Open round: ~50,000 gas

Total Setup: ~750,000 gas
At 30 gwei: ~0.0225 ETH ($70-80)
At 50 gwei: ~0.0375 ETH ($110-130)
```

**Total Deployment Budget**: 0.5 - 1.5 ETH depending on gas prices

---

### Per-Round Operation Costs

#### Owner Operations
```
1. createRound(): ~150,000 gas
2. setValidProof(): ~43,000 gas
3. openRound(): ~50,000 gas
4. closeRound(): ~100,000 gas (+ refund gas if <10 tickets)
5. snapshotRound(): ~30,000 gas
6. commitParticipantsRoot(): ~70,000 gas
7. requestVrf(): ~200,000 gas (+ Chainlink fee)
8. submitWinnersRoot(): ~100,000 gas (+ fee distribution)

Total per round: ~750,000 gas
At 30 gwei: ~0.0225 ETH ($70)
At 50 gwei: ~0.0375 ETH ($110)
```

**Plus Chainlink VRF**: 0.35-0.5 LINK (~$5-10)

---

### User Operation Costs

#### Place Bet
```
First bet (new participant): ~180,000 gas
Subsequent bets: ~100,000 gas

At 30 gwei: 0.003-0.0054 ETH ($9-16)
At 50 gwei: 0.005-0.009 ETH ($15-27)
At 100 gwei: 0.01-0.018 ETH ($30-54)
```

**Problem**: During high gas, users pay more in gas than minimum bet (0.005 ETH)!

**Solutions**:
1. Recommend betting during low-gas periods
2. UI shows estimated gas costs before bet
3. Consider Layer 2 deployment in future (Arbitrum/Optimism)

#### Submit Proof
```
Gas: ~120,000 gas
At 30 gwei: ~0.0036 ETH ($11)
At 50 gwei: ~0.006 ETH ($18)
```

#### Claim Prize
```
Gas: ~150,000 gas (NFT transfer + verification)
At 30 gwei: ~0.0045 ETH ($13)
At 50 gwei: ~0.0075 ETH ($22)
```

---

### Gas Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Batch Operations for Users (Future v2)
```solidity
// Allow betting multiple times in one transaction
function placeBets(uint256[] calldata ticketCounts) external payable {
    for (uint i = 0; i < ticketCounts.length; i++) {
        _placeBet(ticketCounts[i]);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Optimize Storage Patterns
- Pack structs to fit in single slots
- Use smaller uint types where possible
- Consider using mappings instead of arrays where appropriate

#### 3. Event Optimization
- Current: Emits many events
- Consider: Remove non-critical events for mainnet

#### 4. Consider EIP-4844 (Future)
- Store participants/winners data in blobs instead of IPFS
- Significantly cheaper data availability
- Wait for tooling maturity

## MAINNET VS SEPOLIA DIFFERENCES

### 1. Network Parameters

| Aspect | Sepolia | Mainnet | Impact |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Gas Price** | 1-5 gwei | 10-500 gwei | **50-500x higher costs** |
| **Block Time** | ~12s | ~12s | Same |
| **Finality** | ~15 min | ~15 min | Same |
| **LINK Price** | Free (faucet) | ~$12-20 | Need to buy LINK |
| **ETH Value** | $0 (testnet) | $3,000-4,000 | **Real money at risk** |
| **VRF Coordinator** | Test coordinator | Prod coordinator | Different addresses |
| **Etherscan** | sepolia.etherscan.io | etherscan.io | Different block explorers |

---

### 2. Chainlink VRF Differences

| Feature | Sepolia | Mainnet |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Coordinator** | 0x8103B0A8... | 0x271682DE... |
| **LINK Funding** | Faucet | Purchase required |
| **Fulfillment Time** | 30s - 5min | 30s - 5min |
| **Cost per Request** | Free/negligible | 0.35-0.5 LINK + gas |
| **Request Limits** | Relaxed | Production limits apply |

**Key Difference**: On mainnet, if subscription runs out of LINK, VRF requests **will fail**!

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Set up LINK balance monitoring
- [ ] Alert when balance < 5 LINK
- [ ] Auto-top-up system (consider Chainlink Automation)
- [ ] Have emergency LINK reserve ready

---

### 3. Smart Contract Behavior

#### Sepolia: More Forgiving
- Can redeploy easily if bugs found
- Test network, less scrutiny
- Failed transactions = wasted test ETH (no real cost)

#### Mainnet: Unforgiving
- **Contract is immutable** after deployment
- All bugs are public and permanent
- Failed transactions = lost real ETH
- MEV bots may exploit any vulnerabilities
- Front-running is common

---

### 4. User Experience Differences

| Aspect | Sepolia Testing | Mainnet Reality |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **User Errors** | Easy to fix | Costly to fix |
| **Transaction Speed** | Users tolerant | Users expect speed |
| **Gas Costs** | Ignored | Primary concern |
| **Support Burden** | Minimal | High (real money) |
| **Scam Risk** | Low | High (phishing, fake sites) |

---

### 5. Emblem Vault Integration

**Sepolia**:
- Using mock/test Emblem Vault or no NFTs
- NFT transfers not tested with real vault

**Mainnet**:
- Must use real Emblem Vault contract
- Real NFTs with real value
- NFT custody is critical security concern

**CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS**:
- [ ] Verify Emblem Vault mainnet contract address
- [ ] Test NFT custody and transfer flow
- [ ] Document NFT token ID allocation strategy
- [ ] Have emergency NFT recovery procedure
- [ ] Ensure contract can receive and hold ERC721s

---

### 6. Frontend Differences

#### RPC Provider
```javascript
// Sepolia
rpcUrl: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY'

// Mainnet (Need production-tier)
rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROD_KEY'
// OR
rpcUrl: 'https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY'
```

**Considerations**:
- Production RPC providers have rate limits
- Need paid tier for higher request volumes
- Consider load balancing between providers
- Have fallback RPC endpoints

**Costs**:
- Infura: Free tier = 100k requests/day
- Alchemy: Free tier = 300M compute units/month
- Estimate: 1000 users/day = need paid tier (~$50-200/month)

---

### 7. MetaMask/Wallet Differences

**Network Detection**:
```javascript
// Must handle mainnet chain ID
if (chainId !== 1) {
  alert("Please switch to Ethereum Mainnet");
  // Offer to switch automatically
}

  const currentAddress = getCurrentContract().toLowerCase();
  
  if (expectedAddress !== currentAddress) {
    throw new Error('‚ö†Ô∏è CONTRACT MISMATCH - Possible phishing attempt!');
  }
}

// Verify on every page load
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  if (window.ethereum) {
    validateContract(window.ethereum);
  }
});
```

#### Add Domain Verification
```javascript
// Prevent iframe embedding on untrusted sites
if (window.self !== window.top) {
  document.body.innerHTML = 'This application cannot be embedded.';
}

// Check we're on the right domain
if (window.location.hostname !== 'pepedawn.art' && 
    window.location.hostname !== 'www.pepedawn.art') {
  alert('‚ö†Ô∏è You are not on the official website! Beware of phishing.');
}
```

#### Add Content Security Policy
```html
<!-- index.html, main.html, rules.html -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; 
               script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.ethers.io; 
               style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
               connect-src 'self' https://mainnet.infura.io https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com https://etherscan.io https://gateway.pinata.cloud;

### DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

#### Step 1: Deploy Contract (Owner)

```bash
cd contracts

# Ensure environment is set
source .env # or set variables manually

# Verify all variables are set
echo $MAINNET_RPC_URL
echo $VRF_COORDINATOR_MAINNET
echo $CREATORS_ADDRESS
echo $EMBLEM_VAULT_ADDRESS_MAINNET

# Deploy
forge script scripts/forge/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
  --slow # Use slow mode for better gas price

# Save deployment address
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_address>
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Contract deployed at: 0x...
‚úÖ Transaction: 0x...
‚úÖ Gas used: ~4.5M
‚úÖ Cost: ~0.15 ETH (at 30 gwei)
```

**Immediately After**:
1. Save contract address securely
2. Verify on Etherscan it deployed correctly
3. Update all config files

#### Step 2: Verify Contract (If auto-verify failed)

```bash
forge verify-contract \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  PepedawnRaffle \
  --chain mainnet \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
  --watch
```

**Verify Success**:
- [ ] Green checkmark on Etherscan
- [ ] Source code matches deployed bytecode
- [ ] All imports resolved correctly

---

#### Step 3: Add VRF Consumer

```bash
# Via Cast
cast send $VRF_COORDINATOR_MAINNET \
  "addConsumer(uint256,address)" \
  $VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL

# OR via Chainlink UI: https://vrf.chain.link
# 1. Go to your subscription
# 2. Click "Add Consumer"
# 3. Enter CONTRACT_ADDRESS
# 4. Confirm transaction
```

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check contract is added
cast call $VRF_COORDINATOR_MAINNET \
  "getSubscription(uint256)" \
  $VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

#### Step 5: Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Build production version
npm run build

# Test build locally
npm run preview
# Open in browser and test thoroughly

# Deploy via GitHub Actions (push to main)
git add dist/ src/contract-config.js public/deploy/
git commit -m "Deploy mainnet configuration"
git push origin main

# OR deploy manually via FTP
# Use FileZilla or similar to upload dist/* to public_html/
```

**Verify Deployment**:
- [ ] Visit https://pepedawn.art
- [ ] Check contract address is correct
- [ ] Test wallet connection
- [ ] Verify network detection works
- [ ] Check all pages load (index, main, rules)

---

#### Step 6: Transfer Prize NFTs (Critical)

**Before first round opens**:

```bash
# Transfer 10 Emblem Vault NFTs to contract
# For each NFT (token IDs 1-10 or whichever you're using):

cast send $EMBLEM_VAULT_ADDRESS_MAINNET \
  "safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)" \
  $YOUR_ADDRESS \
  $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  <TOKEN_ID> \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL

# Verify contract owns them
cast call $EMBLEM_VAULT_ADDRESS_MAINNET \
  "ownerOf(uint256)" \
  <TOKEN_ID> \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

**Expected**: Contract address is returned

---

#### Step 7: Create First Round

```bash
# Create round
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "createRound()" \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL

# Wait for confirmation
sleep 30

# Set prizes for round 1
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "setPrizesForRound(uint256,uint256[])" \
  1 \
  "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]" \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL

# Set valid proof for round
PROOF_HASH=$(cast keccak "pepedawn2025") # Or whatever puzzle solution
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "setValidProof(uint256,bytes32)" \
  1 \
  $PROOF_HASH \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

---

#### Step 8: Open Round (When Ready)

**DO NOT do this immediately!**

Wait until:
- [ ] Website is live and tested
- [ ] Community is notified
- [ ] Marketing materials are ready
- [ ] Support team is standing by

```bash
# Open round 1
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "openRound(uint256)" \
  1 \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
```

---

#### Step 9: Announce Launch

**Communication Channels**:
1. Twitter/X announcement
2. Discord announcement
3. Email newsletter (if applicable)
4. Website banner
5. Reddit post (if applicable)

**Announcement Template**:

#### Refund Process
1. **Identify affected users**:
   ```bash
   # Get all participants for round
   cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
     "getRoundParticipants(uint256)" \
     $ROUND_ID \
     --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
   ```

2. **Calculate refund amounts**:
   ```bash
   # For each participant
   cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
     "userWageredInRound(uint256,address)" \
     $ROUND_ID \
     $USER_ADDRESS \
     --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL
   ```

3. **Execute refunds**:
   - If automatic refund system works: users call `withdrawRefund()`
   - If manual needed: batch ETH transfers from owner

4. **Communication**:
   ```
   üí∞ REFUND PROCESS
   
   Round X has been cancelled due to [reason].
   
   How to claim your refund:
   1. Go to pepedawn.art
   2. Connect wallet
   3. Click "Withdraw Refund"
   
   Or call withdrawRefund() directly on contract.
   
   Refunds available for 90 days.
   ```

---

### ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

#### Contract Rollback
**Reality**: Smart contracts are immutable, no true rollback possible.

**Options**:
1. Deploy new version and migrate
2. Use emergency pause
3. Process manual refunds

#### Website Rollback
```bash
# Keep previous version backed up
cd frontend
git checkout <previous_commit>
npm run build
# Deploy via FTP/GitHub Actions

# OR if using Cloudflare/CDN with versioning:
# Revert to previous deployment in dashboard
```

#### DNS Rollback
- Namecheap DNS changes take 1-48 hours
- Keep old IP addresses documented
- Consider having backup domain (pepedawn.io?)
