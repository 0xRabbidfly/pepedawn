# Feature Specification: PEPEDAWN betting site with VRF draws and Emblem Vault prizes

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple web site that allows me to connect my ethereum wallet to bet and possibly win an emblem vault containing the counterparty fake rare asset called PEPEDAWN.\n\nThe web page should indicate the prizes as \n1x Fake Pack (3 PEPEDAWN cards)\n1x Kek Pack (2 PEPEDAWN cards)\n8x Pepe Pack (1 PEPEDAWN card)\n\nThe rules will clearly explain the timeline per round (2 weeks), the betting rules, the settlement via Emblem Vault transfer of asset to winners, and the provable and verifiable randomness.\n\nAs each bet rolls in, the leaderboard will post the wallet address and the percentage chance of winning the Fake Pack only. This list is updated with each incoming bet.\n\nThere should be a very beautiful title page with animation and music and an <enter> button, which takes the user to the main betting page. An additional rules pages will have all the details they require to understand the game. The main page with the betting interface will have the leaderboard immediately below it.\n\nThere is an additional <submit puzzle proof> button that allows wallets to also add a solution to a stenographic or cryptographic puzzle. This will add weight to their overall bet by a certain percentage. Only one submission can ever be made per wallet and only for wallets that have already wagered an amount. The weighting rules will be on the about page to help everyone understand how odds can be modified. The idea here is that those without capital can also engage in puzzle solving to enhance their odds of winning."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a wallet holder, I want to connect my Ethereum wallet, place a wager in an
active 2‚Äëweek round, optionally submit a valid puzzle proof to increase my odds,
see my wallet appear on the leaderboard with my current percentage chance of
winning the Fake Pack, and‚Äîafter the round closes‚Äîhave winners selected via
verifiable on‚Äëchain randomness and receive my prize via Emblem Vault transfer if
I win.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an open round, **When** a user connects a wallet and places a bet,
   **Then** the bet is recorded on-chain and the wallet appears on the
   leaderboard with its percentage chance of the Fake Pack displayed.
2. **Given** a wallet that has already wagered, **When** the user submits a
   valid puzzle proof, **Then** the wallet‚Äôs effective weight increases by the
   documented multiplier (capped), and the leaderboard percentage updates.
3. **Given** a round has closed, **When** any wallet attempts to bet, **Then**
   the bet is rejected and an explanation is shown.
4. **Given** a snapshot has been taken, **When** the system requests VRF and
   receives fulfillment, **Then** winners are deterministically reproducible
   from on-chain data and are emitted via events.
5. **Given** winners are assigned, **When** prizes are distributed, **Then** the
   Emblem Vault tokens are transferred to winners‚Äô ETH addresses (or escrowed)
   and the mapping is emitted via events.
6. **Given** the public read endpoints, **When** observers query round status,
   ticket counts, weights, and expected prize counts, **Then** values match
   on-chain state.
7. **Given** a denylisted wallet, **When** it attempts to bet, **Then** the
   system blocks the action per eligibility rules and logs an event.
8. **Given** a wallet that already submitted a proof, **When** it tries again,
   **Then** the submission is rejected with a clear message.

### Edge Cases
- Bet submitted right as round closes ‚Üí reject with reason; no partial accepts.
- Duplicate proof submissions ‚Üí reject; event emitted.
- Proof submission before first wager ‚Üí reject.
- Very small ‚Äúdust‚Äù wagers ‚Üí enforce min stake; show validation error.
- Leaderboard ties and rounding ‚Üí deterministic ordering and rounding policy.
- VRF request failure/timeout ‚Üí retry policy and incident logging.
- Emblem Vault transfer failure ‚Üí escrow and manual claim path with on-chain
  eligibility proof.
- Prize reserves not pre-committed ‚Üí round cannot open; operator alerted.
- Wallet disconnects mid-bet ‚Üí do not create on-chain transaction; show status.

  requesting randomness; draw inputs MUST be reproducible from on-chain data.
