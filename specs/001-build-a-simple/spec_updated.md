# Feature Specification: PEPEDAWN betting site with VRF draws and Emblem Vault prizes

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple web site that allows me to connect my ethereum wallet to bet and possibly win an emblem vault containing the counterparty fake rare asset called PEPEDAWN.\n\nThe web page should indicate the prizes as \n1x Fake Pack (3 PEPEDAWN cards)\n1x Kek Pack (2 PEPEDAWN cards)\n8x Pepe Pack (1 PEPEDAWN card)\n\nThe rules will clearly explain the timeline per round (2 weeks), the betting rules, the settlement via Emblem Vault transfer of asset to winners, and the provable and verifiable randomness.\n\nAs each bet rolls in, the leaderboard will post the wallet address and the percentage chance of winning the Fake Pack only. This list is updated with each incoming bet.\n\nThere should be a very beautiful title page with animation and music and an <enter> button, which takes the user to the main betting page. An additional rules pages will have all the details they require to understand the game. The main page with the betting interface will have the leaderboard immediately below it.\n\nThere is an additional <submit puzzle proof> button that allows wallets to also add a solution to a stenographic or cryptographic puzzle. This will add weight to their overall bet by a certain percentage. Only one submission can ever be made per wallet and only for wallets that have already wagered an amount. The weighting rules will be on the about page to help everyone understand how odds can be modified. The idea here is that those without capital can also engage in puzzle solving to enhance their odds of winning."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a wallet holder, I want to connect my Ethereum wallet, place a wager in an
active 2‚Äëweek round, optionally submit a valid puzzle proof to increase my odds
by 40%, see my wallet appear on the leaderboard with my current percentage
chance of winning, track progress toward the 10-ticket minimum required for
distribution, and‚Äîafter the round closes‚Äîeither receive my prize via Emblem
Vault transfer if I win and the round met the minimum, or receive a full refund
if the round had fewer than 10 tickets, with all outcomes verifiable through
on‚Äëchain randomness and events.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an open round, **When** a user connects a wallet and places a bet,
   **Then** the bet is recorded on-chain, the wallet appears on the leaderboard
   with its percentage chance displayed, and the progress bar updates showing
   tickets toward the 10-ticket minimum.
2. **Given** the owner has set a valid proof hash for a round and a wallet has
   wagered, **When** the user submits a matching proof, **Then** the wallet's
   effective weight increases by 40%, the leaderboard updates, and success
   feedback is shown.
3. **Given** a wallet that has already wagered, **When** the user submits an
   INCORRECT proof hash, **Then** the proof is rejected, no weight bonus is
   applied, the attempt is consumed, and failure feedback is shown.
4. **Given** a round has closed with 10+ tickets, **When** VRF is requested and
   fulfilled, **Then** 10 winners are selected (1st place gets Fake pack, 2nd
   place gets Kek pack, 3rd-10th place each get Pepe pack), and winners are
   reproducible from on-chain data.
5. **Given** a round has closed with fewer than 10 tickets, **When** the round
   is processed, **Then** ALL participants are refunded their full wager
   amount, no fees are collected, and refund events are emitted.
6. **Given** a round with 10+ tickets and weighted distribution, **When**
   winners are selected, **Then** wallets with higher weight have
   proportionally higher odds, and the same wallet CAN appear as multiple
   winners.
7. **Given** winners are assigned, **When** prizes are distributed, **Then**
   the 1st place winner receives Fake pack, 2nd place receives Kek pack,
   3rd-10th place winners each receive one Pepe pack, and Emblem Vault
   assignment events are emitted.
8. **Given** the public read endpoints, **When** observers query round status,
   ticket counts, weights, and progress toward minimum, **Then** values match
   on-chain state.
9. **Given** a denylisted wallet, **When** it attempts to bet, **Then** the
   system blocks the action per eligibility rules and logs an event.
10. **Given** a wallet that already submitted a proof attempt (success or
    fail), **When** it tries again in the same round, **Then** the submission
    is rejected with a clear message.

### Edge Cases
- Bet submitted right as round closes ‚Üí reject with reason; no partial accepts.
- Duplicate proof submissions ‚Üí reject; event emitted; only one attempt allowed.
- Proof submission before first wager ‚Üí reject.
- Incorrect proof submission ‚Üí reject, consume attempt, show failure message.
- Very small "dust" wagers ‚Üí enforce min stake; show validation error.
- Round closes with exactly 10 tickets ‚Üí process normally with VRF draw.
- Round closes with 9 or fewer tickets ‚Üí refund all participants, no VRF.
- Leaderboard shows 0% odds if under 10 tickets ‚Üí warn users of potential refund.
- VRF request on round under 10 tickets ‚Üí blocked; must refund first.
- Same wallet wins multiple prizes ‚Üí allowed; emit separate events per prize.
- Wallet wins 1st place ‚Üí receives Fake pack (highest tier, 3 cards).
- Refund processing when contract has insufficient ETH ‚Üí should never happen
  (escrowed funds); emergency circuit breaker if detected.
- VRF request failure/timeout ‚Üí retry policy and incident logging.
- Emblem Vault transfer failure ‚Üí escrow and manual claim path with on-chain
  eligibility proof.
- Owner forgets to set valid proof before opening round ‚Üí proofs cannot succeed.
- Wallet disconnects mid-bet ‚Üí do not create on-chain transaction; show status.

## User-Facing Behavior Updates (VRF Seed + Merkle + Claims)

### Round States & UI Labels
| State            | On-chain status          | UI label                      | What users see/do |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open             | `Open`                   | **Live: betting open**        | Connect wallet, place bet, submit puzzle proof; live leaderboard shows current % odds. |
| Snapshotted      | `Snapshotted`            | **Snapshotted (inputs locked)** | Leaderboard frozen; show **Participants File (CID)** and **participantsRoot** with a **Verified ‚úì** badge once the client verifies the Merkle root. |
| VRF Requested    | `VRFRequested`           | **Waiting for randomness**    | Spinner/notice about confirmations. |
| VRF Fulfilled    | `VRFFulfilled`           | **Randomness received**       | Display **VRF seed** from on-chain event and reproducibility note. |
| Winners Committed| `WinnersCommitted`       | **Winners finalized**         | Populate **Winners page** from **Winners File (CID)**; winners see **Claim** buttons per prize slot. |
| Closed           | `Closed`                 | **Round closed**              | Historical view; unclaimed prizes/withdraws still available if applicable. |

### Off-chain Files (Displayed & Verified in UI)
- **Participants File (JSON, IPFS CID)** ‚Äî visible at **Snapshotted**:
  ```json
  {
    "roundId": 12,
    "totalWeight": "123456",
    "participants": [
      { "address": "0xAbc...", "weight": "50", "tickets": 10 },
      { "address": "0xDef...", "weight": "5",  "tickets": 1  }
    ],
    "merkle": {
      "root": "0xPARTICIPANTS_ROOT",
      "leafFormat": "keccak256(abi.encode(address, uint128 weight))"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Winners File (JSON, IPFS CID)** ‚Äî visible at **Winners Committed**:
  ```json
  {
    "roundId": 12,
    "vrfSeed": "0xSEED",
    "derivation": "Deterministic expansion from seed + participants",
    "winners": [
      { "address": "0xAbc...", "prizeTier": 3, "prizeIndex": 0 },
      { "address": "0x123...", "prizeTier": 2, "prizeIndex": 1 }
    ],
    "merkle": {
      "root": "0xWINNERS_ROOT",
      "leafFormat": "keccak256(abi.encode(address, uint8 prizeTier, uint8 prizeIndex))"
    }
  }
  ```

**Client Verification:** The UI must verify that each file's `merkle.root` equals the corresponding on-chain root and display a **Verified ‚úì** badge when matched.

### Weights & Winners Semantics
- **Ticket-level without replacement**: a wallet can win **multiple times up to the number of tickets it holds** (e.g., 4 tickets ‚áí at most 4 wins).
- **Prize slots**: There are **10 prize slots** indexed `0..9`. Each slot has a **deterministic prize tier** derived from the seed; it is displayed and committed in the Winners File.

### Claims & Refunds (Pull-Payments)
- **Claims**: For each `prizeIndex` where the connected wallet appears in the Winners File, show a **Claim** button. The app generates a Merkle proof client-side and calls `claim(roundId, prizeIndex, prizeTier, proof)`. After success, show **Claimed ‚úì** and disable that slot.
- **Refunds**: If a refund is accrued for a wallet, show **Withdraw Refund**; clicking calls `withdrawRefund()` and, on success, shows **Refund withdrawn ‚úì**.

### Leaderboard Behavior
- While **Open**, show live odds (% chance) based on tickets and puzzle boosts.
- At **Snapshotted**, **freeze** the leaderboard and show the **Participants File (CID)** + **participantsRoot** with a verification badge.
- At **Winners Committed**, render the winners table from the Winners File: `address`, `prizeTier`, and `prizeIndex`; show **Claim** buttons for the connected winner.

### Governance (User-Visible)
- The owner may **denylist** addresses (policy transparent in UI). A denylisted wallet cannot place bets; the UI shows a clear error and a link to the policy.

### Verifiability & Transparency (NFR)
- Display CIDs and on-chain roots for both files; verify Merkle roots client-side.
- Display the **VRF seed** with a link to the on-chain fulfillment event.
- Document the deterministic derivation so users can reproduce the winners list off-chain.

### Functional Requirements (Additions)
- **FR-009**: Show **Snapshotted** state with a link to the **Participants File (CID)** and the **participantsRoot**; freeze leaderboard; display **Verified ‚úì** when the root matches.
- **FR-010**: Show **Randomness received** with the **VRF seed**.
- **FR-011**: Show **Winners finalized** with the **Winners File (CID)** and **winnersRoot**; render winners page.
- **FR-012**: Implement **Claim** per `prizeIndex` using a Merkle proof (`keccak256(abi.encode(address, uint8 prizeTier, uint8 prizeIndex))`); prevent double-claims.
- **FR-013**: Implement **Withdraw Refund** button calling `withdrawRefund()`; surface success/failure.
- **FR-014**: Show **Verified ‚úì** badges after client-side checks pass.
- **FR-015**: Clarify that a wallet may win **multiple times up to its ticket count**.

### Edge Cases / Failure Modes (UX)
- **Bad Merkle proof** ‚Üí ‚ÄúVerification failed‚Äîcheck your wallet and try again.‚Äù Keep Claim enabled.
- **Already claimed** ‚Üí show ‚ÄúAlready claimed‚Äù and disable that slot.
- **Refund = 0** ‚Üí disable Withdraw with tooltip ‚ÄúNo refund available.‚Äù
- **Denylisted** ‚Üí block betting with explicit message and policy link.
- **IPFS fetch failed** ‚Üí retry option + copyable CID to use any public gateway.
- **Verification mismatch** (file root ‚â† on-chain root) ‚Üí red warning banner and hide Claim.

### UI Copy (Strings)
