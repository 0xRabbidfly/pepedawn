# Tasks: PEPEDAWN betting site with VRF draws and Emblem Vault prizes

**Input**: Design documents from `Z:\Projects\pepedawn\specs\001-build-a-simple\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ FOUND: Tech stack (Vite MPA + Solidity 0.8.19), libraries (ethers v6, Foundry)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: 7 entities (Round, Wager, Wallet, PuzzleProof, PrizeTier, WinnerAssignment, LeaderboardEntry)
   → ✅ contracts/: 2 API specs (smart-contract-interface.md, frontend-api.md)
   → ✅ research.md: Technology decisions and security requirements
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Environment, dependencies, security configuration
   → Tests: Contract tests (9 existing), integration tests, security tests
   → Core: Smart contract enhancements, frontend components
   → Integration: Wallet connection, VRF integration, event handling
   → Security: Constitutional v1.1.0 compliance implementation
   → Polish: Performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: ✅ All requirements covered
```
