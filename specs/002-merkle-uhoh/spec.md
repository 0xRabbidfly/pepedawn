## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a wallet holder, I want to connect my Ethereum wallet, place a wager in an active 2‚Äëweek round, optionally submit a valid puzzle proof to increase my odds by 40%, see my wallet appear on the leaderboard with my current percentage chance of winning, track progress toward the 10-ticket minimum required for distribution, observe transparent round state transitions with verifiable Merkle proofs and VRF randomness, and‚Äîafter the round closes‚Äîeither claim my prize through a pull-payment system if I win (with the round meeting the minimum), or withdraw my full refund if the round had fewer than 10 tickets, with all outcomes verifiable through on‚Äëchain data, IPFS files, and client-side verification.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Betting Phase
1. **Given** an open round, **When** a user connects a wallet and places a bet,
   **Then** the bet is recorded on-chain, the wallet appears on the leaderboard
   with its percentage chance displayed, and the progress bar updates showing
   tickets toward the 10-ticket minimum.
2. **Given** the owner has set a valid proof hash for a round and a wallet has
   wagered, **When** the user submits a matching proof, **Then** the wallet's
   effective weight increases by 40%, the leaderboard updates, and success
   feedback is shown.
3. **Given** a wallet that has already wagered, **When** the user submits an
   INCORRECT proof hash, **Then** the proof is rejected, no weight bonus is
   applied, the attempt is consumed, and failure feedback is shown.

#### Round State Progression
4. **Given** a round is in "Open" state, **When** I visit the application, **Then** I see "Live: betting open" with live leaderboard showing current percentage odds and can place bets and submit puzzle proofs.
5. **Given** a round transitions to "Snapshotted" state, **When** I view the round, **Then** I see "Snapshotted (inputs locked)" with a frozen leaderboard, a link to the Participants File (CID), the participantsRoot hash, and a "Verified ‚úì" badge once client-side verification passes.
6. **Given** a round is in "VRF Requested" state, **When** I check the status, **Then** I see "Waiting for randomness" with a spinner and information about confirmation progress.
7. **Given** VRF is fulfilled, **When** I view the round, **Then** I see "Randomness received" with the VRF seed displayed and a note about reproducibility.

#### Winner Selection & Claims (RAFFLE MODEL)
8. **Given** a round has closed with 10+ tickets, **When** VRF is requested and
   fulfilled, **Then** 10 winners are selected using raffle mechanics (1st place 
   gets Fake pack, 2nd place gets Kek pack, 3rd-10th place each get Pepe pack), 
   where each ticket is an entry that gets "consumed" when drawn, and winners are
   reproducible from on-chain data.
9. **Given** winners are committed, **When** I am a winner, **Then** I see "Winners finalized" with access to the Winners File, and "Claim" buttons for each prize slot I won.
10. **Given** I have won a prize, **When** I click "Claim" for a specific prize slot, **Then** the system generates a Merkle proof and submits my claim, showing "Claimed ‚úì" upon success.
11. **Given** a round with 10+ tickets and weighted raffle distribution, **When**
    winners are selected, **Then** wallets with more tickets have proportionally 
    higher odds, each ticket acts as a raffle entry that is consumed on win, and 
    the same wallet CAN win multiple prizes (up to their ticket count).

#### Refunds
12. **Given** a round has closed with fewer than 10 tickets, **When** the round
    is processed, **Then** ALL participants are refunded their full wager
    amount, no fees are collected, and refund events are emitted.
13. **Given** I have a refund available, **When** I click "Withdraw Refund", **Then** the system processes my refund and shows "Refund withdrawn ‚úì" upon success.

#### Verification & Transparency
14. **Given** the public read endpoints, **When** observers query round status,
    ticket counts, weights, and progress toward minimum, **Then** values match
    on-chain state.
15. **Given** Participants File and Winners File are available, **When** I download and verify them, **Then** their Merkle roots match the on-chain committed roots and display "Verified ‚úì" badges.

#### Governance
16. **Given** a denylisted wallet, **When** it attempts to bet, **Then** the
    system blocks the action per eligibility rules and logs an event with explicit error message and policy link.
17. **Given** a wallet that already submitted a proof attempt (success or
    fail), **When** it tries again in the same round, **Then** the submission
    is rejected with a clear message.

### Edge Cases
- Bet submitted right as round closes ‚Üí reject with reason; no partial accepts.
- Duplicate proof submissions ‚Üí reject; event emitted; only one attempt allowed.
- Proof submission before first wager ‚Üí reject.
- Incorrect proof submission ‚Üí reject, consume attempt, show failure message.
- Very small "dust" wagers ‚Üí enforce min stake; show validation error.
- Round closes with exactly 10 tickets ‚Üí process normally with VRF draw.
- Round closes with 9 or fewer tickets ‚Üí refund all participants, no VRF.
- Leaderboard shows 0% odds if under 10 tickets ‚Üí warn users of potential refund.
- VRF request on round under 10 tickets ‚Üí blocked; must refund first.
- Same wallet wins multiple prizes ‚Üí allowed; emit separate events per prize; show multiple Claim buttons.
- Wallet wins 1st place ‚Üí receives Fake pack (highest tier, 3 cards).
- Refund processing when contract has insufficient ETH ‚Üí should never happen
  (escrowed funds); emergency circuit breaker if detected.
- VRF request failure/timeout ‚Üí retry policy and incident logging.
- VRF subscription underfunded ‚Üí request fails; owner must add LINK to subscription; retry randomness request.
- Contract doesn't hold required Emblem Vault NFT when claim() called ‚Üí transaction reverts; owner must transfer missing NFT to contract; winner can retry claim.
- Owner forgets to set valid proof before opening round ‚Üí proofs cannot succeed.
- Wallet disconnects mid-bet ‚Üí do not create on-chain transaction; show status.
- IPFS file fetch fails ‚Üí Show retry option with copyable CID for alternative gateways; show "service unavailable" after 60 seconds.
- Invalid Merkle proofs ‚Üí Show "Verification failed" message and keep Claim button enabled for manual retry.
- User tries to claim already claimed prize ‚Üí Show "Already claimed" and disable that specific slot.
- Denylisted users ‚Üí Block betting with explicit message and policy link.
- File verification fails (root mismatch) ‚Üí Show red warning banner and hide Claim buttons.
- Claim transaction fails (gas, network error) ‚Üí Show error message with reason; keep Claim button enabled; no automatic retry.
- Large participant count (500+ wallets) ‚Üí Show top 20 participants with "View all" option.

  - A single wallet's cumulative wagers per round MUST NOT exceed 1.0 ETH.
  - Attempts to exceed this cap MUST be rejected and an event MUST be emitted.
- **FR-024**: Fee schedule:

  - Refunds MUST be processed from the contract's ETH balance.
  - No fees are collected on refunded rounds.
  - Refund events MUST be emitted for each participant.
- **FR-026**: Winner selection (weighted raffle):
  - Winners are selected using RAFFLE MECHANICS: each ticket is an entry that gets consumed when drawn.
  - Each ticket has a weight (1 base, or 1.4 with proof bonus) that determines selection probability.
  - When a ticket wins, it is REMOVED from the pool, reducing both ticket count and total weight.
  - A wallet with more tickets/weight has proportionally higher odds AND can win multiple prizes (up to ticket count).
  - The same wallet address CAN win multiple prizes in a single round (maximum = number of tickets purchased).
  - Each prize draw uses the remaining pool of tickets, with dynamically updated odds.
  - Winner selection algorithm MUST be deterministic and reproducible from VRF seed.

- **FR-027**: Leaderboard and progress tracking:
  - The leaderboard MUST display all participating wallets with their current odds.
  - A progress indicator MUST show tickets purchased toward the 10-ticket minimum.
  - Progress bar format: "X / 10 tickets needed for round distribution"
  - If threshold not met by round end, participants MUST be notified of pending refund.
- **FR-028**: Round state transitions MUST be manually controlled by the contract owner:
  - Owner calls snapshotRound() to transition from Open ‚Üí Snapshotted
  - Owner calls requestRandomness() to transition from Snapshotted ‚Üí VRF Requested
  - VRF callback automatically transitions VRF Requested ‚Üí VRF Fulfilled
  - Owner calls commitWinners() to transition from VRF Fulfilled ‚Üí Winners Committed
  - Owner calls closeRound() to transition from Winners Committed ‚Üí Closed
  - Each transition MUST emit appropriate events for observability
- **FR-029**: IPFS file generation and publication MUST be performed off-chain by the contract owner:
  - Owner uses provided scripts to query contract state and generate Participants File (after snapshot) and Winners File (after VRF fulfillment)
  - Owner uploads files to IPFS using free pinning services (e.g., NFT.Storage, Web3.Storage, Pinata)
  - Owner commits the resulting CIDs on-chain via contract function calls
  - Scripts MUST include clear step-by-step instructions for the manual workflow
  - Contract events MUST emit all data necessary to reconstruct files for verification
- **FR-030**: Storage efficiency MUST be optimized for indefinite on-chain retention:
  - Round data stored using efficient patterns (Merkle roots for participants/winners instead of full mappings)
  - Detailed participant/winner data emitted in events (lower gas cost than storage)
  - Core round metadata (timestamps, status, roots, VRF seed) stored on-chain
  - IPFS CIDs (32 bytes each) stored on-chain for verifiable off-chain data retrieval
  - Design target: Support 100+ rounds on-chain without prohibitive gas costs

#### UI/UX & Round State Visualization (FR-031 to FR-047)

## Detailed User Interface Specifications

### Round States & UI Labels
| State            | On-chain status          | UI label                      | What users see/do |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open             | `Open`                   | **Live: betting open**        | Connect wallet, place bet, submit puzzle proof; live leaderboard shows current % odds. |
| Snapshotted      | `Snapshotted`            | **Snapshotted (inputs locked)** | Leaderboard frozen; show **Participants File (CID)** and **participantsRoot** with a **Verified ‚úì** badge once the client verifies the Merkle root. |
| VRF Requested    | `VRFRequested`           | **Waiting for randomness**    | Spinner/notice about confirmations. |
| VRF Fulfilled    | `VRFFulfilled`           | **Randomness received**       | Display **VRF seed** from on-chain event and reproducibility note. |
| Winners Committed| `WinnersCommitted`       | **Winners finalized**         | Populate **Winners page** from **Winners File (CID)**; winners see **Claim** buttons per prize slot. |
| Closed           | `Closed`                 | **Round closed**              | Historical view; unclaimed prizes/withdraws still available if applicable. |

### Off-chain Files (Displayed & Verified in UI)
**Client Verification:** The UI must verify that each file's `merkle.root` equals the corresponding on-chain root and display a **Verified ‚úì** badge when matched.

### Weights & Winners Semantics
- **Ticket-level without replacement**: a wallet can win **multiple times up to the number of tickets it holds** (e.g., 4 tickets ‚áí at most 4 wins).
- **Prize slots**: There are **10 prize slots** indexed `0..9`. Each slot has a **deterministic prize tier** derived from the seed; it is displayed and committed in the Winners File.

### Claims & Refunds (Pull-Payments)
- **Claims**: For each `prizeIndex` where the connected wallet appears in the Winners File, show a **Claim** button. The app generates a Merkle proof client-side and calls `claim(roundId, prizeIndex, prizeTier, proof)`. After success, show **Claimed ‚úì** and disable that slot.
- **Refunds**: If a refund is accrued for a wallet, show **Withdraw Refund**; clicking calls `withdrawRefund()` and, on success, shows **Refund withdrawn ‚úì**.

### Leaderboard Behavior
- While **Open**, show live odds (% chance) based on tickets and puzzle boosts; display top 20 participants by default with "View all" option for larger participant lists.
- At **Snapshotted**, **freeze** the leaderboard and show the **Participants File (CID)** + **participantsRoot** with a verification badge; maintain top 20 display with "View all" option.
- At **Winners Committed**, render the winners table from the Winners File: `address`, `prizeTier`, and `prizeIndex`; show **Claim** buttons for the connected winner.

### Governance (User-Visible)
- The owner may **denylist** addresses (policy transparent in UI). A denylisted wallet cannot place bets; the UI shows a clear error and a link to the policy.

### Verifiability & Transparency (NFR)
- Display CIDs and on-chain roots for both files; verify Merkle roots client-side.
- Display the **VRF seed** with a link to the on-chain fulfillment event.
- Document the deterministic derivation so users can reproduce the winners list off-chain.

### Observability (NFR)
- Log all errors: failed claims, verification failures, IPFS timeouts, transaction rejections.
- Log critical actions: claims submitted (with roundId, prizeIndex), refunds withdrawn (with amount), Merkle verification completed (with success/failure status), wallet connections, round state transitions viewed.

### Mobile Support (NFR)
- Application MUST be fully responsive across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- All features MUST function on mobile browsers with mobile wallet support (MetaMask mobile, WalletConnect, etc.).
- UI elements MUST be touch-friendly with appropriate tap targets (minimum 44x44px).
- Tables and lists MUST adapt to narrow screens (stacked layouts, horizontal scrolling where appropriate).
- Long addresses and hashes MUST be truncated with copy-to-clipboard functionality on mobile.

### Edge Cases / Failure Modes (UX)
- **Bad Merkle proof** ‚Üí "Verification failed‚Äîcheck your wallet and try again." Keep Claim enabled.
- **Already claimed** ‚Üí show "Already claimed" and disable that slot.
- **Claim transaction failed** ‚Üí display error message with reason (insufficient gas, network error, user rejection); keep Claim button enabled for manual retry; no automatic retry.
- **Refund transaction failed** ‚Üí display error message; keep Withdraw Refund button enabled for manual retry.
- **Refund = 0** ‚Üí disable Withdraw with tooltip "No refund available."
- **Denylisted** ‚Üí block betting with explicit message and policy link.
- **IPFS fetch failed** ‚Üí retry option + copyable CID to use any public gateway; show "service unavailable" after 60 seconds.
- **Verification mismatch** (file root ‚â† on-chain root) ‚Üí red warning banner and hide Claim.

### UI Copy (Strings)
- "**Snapshotted (inputs locked)** ‚Äî verified root: `0x‚Ä¶` ‚Äî [View participants.json]"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: When IPFS file fetches fail and users retry, what is the acceptable maximum wait time before the system should show a "service unavailable" message? ‚Üí A: 60 seconds - maximize chance of success
- Q: For the leaderboard with live odds, what should happen when there are a large number of participants (e.g., 500+ wallets)? ‚Üí A: Show top 20 participants with "View all" option
- Q: What user actions or events should be logged for observability and debugging purposes? ‚Üí A: Errors + critical actions (claims submitted, refunds withdrawn, verification completed)
- Q: Should the application support mobile devices, and if so, what is the minimum acceptable experience? ‚Üí A: Mobile responsive - all features must work on mobile browsers
- Q: When a user attempts to claim a prize but the transaction fails (e.g., insufficient gas, network error), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error only - user must manually retry
- Q: Round lifecycle automation: How are round state transitions triggered? ‚Üí A: Fully manual - Owner manually calls functions to transition each state (snapshot, request VRF, commit winners, close)
- Q: IPFS file publication: Who creates and publishes the Participants File and Winners File to IPFS? ‚Üí A: Contract owner off-chain - Owner generates files locally using provided scripts, uploads to IPFS, then commits CIDs on-chain via contract calls
- Q: Emblem Vault prize distribution: How are the actual Emblem Vault NFTs transferred to winners? ‚Üí A: Contract holds vaults - Contract owns the Emblem Vault NFTs; winners call claim() to trigger automatic transfer
- Q: Chainlink VRF subscription management: Who funds and manages the VRF subscription? ‚Üí A: Contract owner external - Owner creates/funds subscription externally via Chainlink dashboard/CLI; contract uses the subscription ID
- Q: Data retention and historical access: How long must past round data remain accessible on-chain and via the UI? ‚Üí A: Indefinite on-chain - All round data stored on-chain forever using efficient patterns (Merkle roots); UI shows all historical rounds with full details
